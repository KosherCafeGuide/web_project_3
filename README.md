**Intro 1 Description of project and its functionality.**    
  
This is a project that showcases the hometowns of some of Practicum's employees. We've made it so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.
